            <p class="fw-bold">Few weeks ago <span> <i class="fw-bold">“world mental health day”</i> </span> was celebrated and I have just one question to ask you.</p>
            <p class="fw-bold">How are you?</p>
            <p class="fw-bold">I would like you to deeply reflect on that question before you answer because I know your default response would be “I am fine” but are you truly fine? <br> <br>
            Sometime back I watched a video on Tiktok in which 10 women were asked if they were okay and their responses were all an affirmative <span class="fst-italic">“yes”</span>. They were asked that same question again and upon proper reflection, turns out that they all had problems they were dealing with.</p>
